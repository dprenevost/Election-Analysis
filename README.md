## Challenge Overview

- Use Python to calculate the 5 requirements listed above
  - Implement the lessons in Module 3 and the new concepts
  - Consider using methods to simplify the code where approriate

# Challenge Summary
This script can be used in a variety of election situations with some modifications to the variables.
For instance it can, if the data were available:
